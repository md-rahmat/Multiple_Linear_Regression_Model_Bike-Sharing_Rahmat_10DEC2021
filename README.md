# Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model_Bike-Sharing

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
<b>Problem Statement:</b> A US bike-sharing provider `BoomBikes` has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.<br>

<b><u>Business objective:</b> The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.<br> 
<br>    
    
<b>The Bike Sharing company wants to know the following:</b><br>
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.<br>
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands

**<h3><u>Assignment Steps:</u></h3>**

**1.Data Understanding and Exploration**<br>
**2.Data Transformation**   
**3.Data Visualization**<br>
>Perform EDA to understand various variables.<br>
>Check the correlation between the variables.   

**4.Data Preparation**<br>
>Create dummy variables for all the categorical features.<br>
>Divide the data to train & Test.<>br
>Perform Scaling.<br>
>Divide data into dependent & Independent variables.
    
**5.Data Modelling & Evaluation**<br>
>Create Linear Regression model using mixed approach (RFE & VIF/p-value).<br>
>Check the various assumptions.<br>
>Check the Adjusted R-Square for both train & Test data.<br>
